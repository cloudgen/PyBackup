and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.26.0] - 2026-10-14

### Changed

- **Front board numbers.** On a terminal the front board lists client-side (**1**), sudoers (**5**), self-management (**6**), language (**7**), and Exit (**9**). Server-side stays hidden as **2**. Sudoers prints **52** and **55**. Reserved numbers are **51**, **53**, and **54**. Self-management is **61**–**67**. Language is **71** English through **78** Korean.
- **OS family labels.** Eight requirements name the same host families as sibling tn5250-cli: Windows Git Bash (Windows Command Prompt stays a peer in that file), Debian 12 and 13, Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, and 26.04, other Linux, Alpine, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Termux, and macOS. This program does not install compiler packages. The live cache split remains `linux`, `gitbash`, and `mac`. It does not read `/etc/os-release` and does not refuse an unknown host.
- **README boards.** Quick Installation shows the live terminal boards at this version: front, client-side, sudoers, self-management, and language.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=610 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-13**, **TP-CLI-24**, **TP-CLI-12**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.13.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-language** **1.2.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-sudoers-submenu** **1.5.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.13.0**, **requirement-shell-local-self-management** **1.3.3**, **requirement-domain-folder-backup** **1.6.11**, **requirement-bootstrap-chain** **2.4.0**, and the eight family files at **1.0.0**.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-10-10

### Changed

- **Not-available lines use one sentence shape.** On a terminal, the front board says `server-side is not available: this program does not run a host service. Number 2 stays reserved.` The sudoers board says `test commands are not available: type generate-sudoer-request, print-sudoers, or print-sudoers-install-script. Numbers 71, 73, and 74 stay reserved.` The other seven display languages use the same shape. Row **2** stays unprinted. Numbers **71**, **73**, and **74** stay unprinted.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=610 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-13**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.12.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-sudoers-submenu** **1.3.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-language** **1.1.1**.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- **Archive file count is regular files.** Stage verify compares `find -type f` with `tar -tvzf` members whose type is `-` or hard-link `h`. Symlinks, directories, fifos, sockets, and device nodes stay in the archive and in the member check. They are not archive files. The archive is still created without `-h`. A root-owned deposit that this process cannot read still re-lists members with allowlisted `tar -tzf` and does not pretend those lines are the file count. Law: `requirement-folder-archive-backup` **1.3.0**. Suite: **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-28**.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Human help and human about follow the display language.** The eight codes stay English, Traditional Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Section headings and the prose after command names follow that code. Command tokens, flags, paths, and environment names stay Latin. JSON `about` and `folder-backup version` stay English. Operational command output stays English.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=596 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-24**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-language** **1.1.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.12.1**, **requirement-shell-cli-storage** **1.5.1**, **requirement-domain-folder-backup** **1.6.10**.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Menu 6 chooses the display language.** On a terminal, the front board lists client-side (**1**), language (**6**), sudoers (**7**), self-management (**8**), and Exit (**9**). Server-side stays hidden. Language rows are **61** English, **62** Traditional Chinese, **63** Spanish, **64** French, **65** German, **66** Simplified Chinese, **67** Japanese, and **68** Korean. A pick is saved at `~/.local/folder-backup/language` (mode 0600) and the front board comes back in that language. **0** returns without saving. `FOLDER_BACKUP_LANG` forces one run and does not write the file. `folder-backup language` stays unknown.
- Human `help` translates the usage heading, the menu sentence, and the language catalog. Human `about` translates the title and the cache-used label. The rest of those screens stay English. JSON help, JSON about, and `folder-backup version` stay English.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=570 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-24** · **TP-CLI-13**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-language** **1.0.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.11.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.12.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-storage** **1.5.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-sudoers-submenu** **1.2.1**, **requirement-domain-folder-backup** **1.6.9**, **requirement-shell-modular-function-design** **1.0.2**.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Sudoers is front row 7.** On a terminal, the front board lists client-side (**1**), sudoers (**7**), self-management (**8**), and Exit (**9**). Server-side stays hidden and number **2** stays reserved. Client-side lists backup (**11**) and restore (**12**). The sudoers board lists `submit-sudoer-request` (**72**) and `remove-project-sudoers` (**75**). Test commands stay typed; numbers **71**, **73**, and **74** stay reserved. **0** on the sudoers board returns to the front. `folder-backup sudoers` stays unknown.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=481 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-13** · **TP-CLI-18**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.10.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-sudoers-submenu** **1.2.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.11.0**, **requirement-domain-folder-backup** **1.6.8**.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Named menu off a terminal stops.** `menu`, `main`, and `self-management` with no terminal exit 1: `menu needs a terminal` (or `self-management needs a terminal`). Next step is `folder-backup help`. `--json` on that line is a JSON error. On a real terminal, `menu --json` still draws the boards.
- **Empty Enter on the front leaves.** An empty line, or `q`, is Exit. On a child board, an empty line or `q` is Back.
- **Row 82 is diagnostics.** On a numbered board, row **82** and a typed `version` run `about`. `folder-backup version` stays the thin version line.
- **A pipe with no command still places this program.** That 1.19.0 route is unchanged. Local `install` stays the mode `0755` copy.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=473 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-15** · **TP-CLI-21**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.9.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments** **1.2.1**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.10.1**, **requirement-shell-interactive-vs-noninteractive** **1.1.3**.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **A pipe with no command places this program.** On a real terminal, no command (and `--debug` or `--force` with no command) still opens the numbered boards. A pipe, no TTY, `--quiet`, or `--json` with no command calls `inst_self_install`: a checkout file is copied (mode `0700` for your login, `0755` for root) and a pipe downloads. Naming `menu` or `self-management` off a terminal still prints help. Local `install` stays the mode `0755` copy and is not this route.
- **Install lead.** README Quick Installation leads with `curl … | sh`. That line is the place. It does not print help.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=455 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-07** · **TP-CLI-23**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments** **Active 1.2.0** (owner of the split), **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.8.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.10.0**, **requirement-bootstrap-chain** **2.3.0**, **requirement-shell-local-self-management** **1.3.2**, **requirement-shell-interactive-vs-noninteractive** **1.1.2**, **requirement-class-software-dev** **1.1.5**.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Numbered boards replace the flat work list.** On a terminal, no arguments (and `menu` / `main`) shows client-side (**1**), self-management (**8**), and Exit (**9**). Server-side is hidden and number **2** stays reserved. Client-side lists backup (**11**), restore (**12**), and sudoers (**17**). The sudoers board lists `submit-sudoer-request` (**172**) and `remove-project-sudoers` (**175**). Test commands stay typed; numbers **171**, **173**, and **174** stay reserved. Self-management lists local `install` (**81**) through `self-install` (**87**). Child boards use **0** Back. A finished command redisplays the front board. Off a terminal, no arguments and `self-management` still show help. `folder-backup sudoers` stays unknown.
- **Menu ink.** On a terminal the short name is bold. The description stays italic and light gray. The number, Exit, and Back stay plain.
- **Suite.** `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=436 FAIL=0 SKIP=2. Proof **TP-CLI-13** · **TP-CLI-14** · **TP-CLI-15** · **TP-CLI-18** · **TP-CLI-19** · **TP-CLI-21**.
- Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.7.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-sudoers-submenu** **1.1.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.9.1**, **requirement-domain-folder-backup** **1.6.7**, **requirement-shell-output-requirements** **1.1.2**, **requirement-bootstrap-chain** **2.2.1**, **requirement-shell-local-self-management** **1.3.1**, **requirement-class-software-dev** **1.1.4**. Version cells point at the ship unit hard-assign.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Rebuilt from sibling selfmanaged.** The ship unit keeps that parent’s self-install, version-check, self-update, self-uninstall, and self-management board, and keeps folder-backup’s backup, restore, and sudoers verbs. Direction is selfmanaged → folder-backup. The parent tree was not edited.
- **Main menu is unchanged.** On a terminal, no arguments shows `1 backup`, `2 restore`, `3 sudoers`, `9 Exit`. Off a terminal, no arguments shows help. `install` still copies this file (mode 0755). `self-install` is the extra channel verb.
- **Cache leaf** stays the 1.16.5 contract: per login and per process. `about` prints Cache folder used, preferred, 1st fallback, and 2nd fallback. JSON keeps `cache_used`, `cache_fallback_2`, `persistence_storage`, and `effective_storage`. `SELFMANAGED_CACHE_HOST` still works beside `FOLDER_BACKUP_CACHE_HOST`.
- **Download integrity.** `self-install` and `self-update` fetch `src/folder-backup.sha256` beside the raw script when `CHECKSUM` is unset. Algorithm is SHA-256. A match continues. A mismatch aborts. A missing companion warns and continues. Local `install` does not download.
- **Suite.** Channel verbs stay off the main menu (TP-CLI-16). Cache about lines match 1.16.5 (TP-CLI-06, TP-CLI-12). `sh tests/run.sh`: PASS=418 FAIL=0 SKIP=2.
- Law: **requirement-bootstrap-chain** **2.2.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-interface** **1.9.0**, **requirement-shell-cli-storage** **1.4.1**, **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.6.1**, **requirement-shell-interactive-vs-noninteractive** **1.1.1**.

## [1.16.5] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- **Scratch is one folder per login and per process.** On Linux the preferred folder is `/dev/shm/cache/cache-folder-backup-<login>-<pid>`, then `/tmp/cache/cache-folder-backup-<login>-<pid>`, then `${HOME}/.cache/cache-folder-backup-<pid>`. Git Bash prefers `/tmp/cache/...` then `${HOME}/AppData/Local/Temp/cache-folder-backup-<pid>` (no second fallback). Mac prefers `/tmp/cache/...`, then `${HOME}/Library/Caches/cache-folder-backup-<pid>`, then `${HOME}/cache/cache-folder-backup-<pid>`. A skipped folder is silent. An error is only when every folder on this host fails. Files inside the folder stay `mktemp` names. Durable data stays `${HOME}/.local/folder-backup` (no login suffix, no process id). Human `about` prints **Cache folder used**, **Cache folder (preferred)**, **Cache folder (1st fallback)**, **Cache folder (2nd fallback)** when that host has one, and **Persistence storage**. JSON uses `cache_used`, `cache_preferred`, `cache_fallback`, `cache_fallback_2`, and `persistence_storage`. Law: **requirement-shell-cli-storage** **1.4.0**. Suite **TP-CLI-06** · **TP-CLI-12** (PASS=410 FAIL=0 SKIP=2).

## [1.16.4] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **Cache leaf is private to this login.** `util_resolve_storage` keeps `/dev/shm/cache/cache-folder-backup` (then `/tmp/cache/…`, then the home cache) only when this login owns a real directory and `chmod 0700` sticks. Another login’s writable leaf, a symlink, or a group/world-open directory falls through. Human `about` prints **Cache folder (live)** next to preferred and fallback. Law: **requirement-shell-cli-storage** **1.3.0**. Suite **TP-CLI-06** · **TP-CLI-12**.
- **Draft picker no longer captures `read`.** Multi-draft `remove-project-sudoers` calls `prompt_ask` in the current shell and reads `PROMPT_ASK_VALUE`. The question is no longer glued onto the number (`Choose draft number to remove: 2`). Law: **requirement-shell-interactive-vs-noninteractive** **1.1.0**. Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-15c** · **TP-CLI-20**.

## [1.16.3] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **Help lists grant-emit testers apart from work commands.** Human help now has **Work commands:** (`backup` / `restore` / `remove-project-sudoers` / `submit-sudoer-request`) then **Grant and draft setup (tests and review):** (`print-sudoers` / `print-sudoers-install-script` / `generate-sudoer-request`). Closes AC-9 / **TP-CLI-17**. Lifecycle heading is people-facing (no Type-N lead).
- **Product README** Description uses one sentence, three boxes, includes/excludes, and a practice table of what you type. Features are outcomes, not a verb catalog. Related Projects no longer leads with Type 0.
- **Requirements:** every registered `requirement-*.md` has **§1.1 Human-facing**; related shell files have a section **Under command line for normal user only**. New **`requirement-shell-script-coding`** (specialize-in home) and **`requirement-shell-sudo-command`** (studied allow table; wrap still Gap). Compact JSON `--json` twins remain Gap (**TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-27**).

### Fixed

- CLI suite isolates HOME before `about`/`version` so those paths do not mkdir on the live login. **TP-CLI-10** also rejects `self-uninstall`. **TP-CLI-13** covers TTY `main`.

## [1.16.2] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **Suite no longer queues live sudoer inbound.** TP-CLI-13 proved the five grant/draft verbs by actually running `submit-sudoer-request` against the host (`sudoer-cli` 1.17.1 → `/var/sudoer-cli/sudoer-request`). Isolation now defaults to a missing `SUDOER_CLI` plus a temp queue trio; submit with `SUDOER_QUEUE_INBOUND` passes `--queue-root` to sudoer-cli; the runner asserts this user’s live inbound files did not grow. Lesson **L-INBOUND-02**.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **Sudoers submenu is its own product law** (`requirement-shell-cli-sudoers-submenu` **1.0.0**). The start list still hosts family row **3** (`requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction` **1.6.0**). Menu behavior is unchanged: five grant/draft setup verbs stay live CLI commands; `folder-backup sudoers` stays unknown. Portable pack (H1 include): **`LM-CLI-SUDOERS-SUBMENU`** · **`SK-CLI-SUDOERS-SUBMENU`** · term `cli-sudoers-submenu`. Proof still **TP-CLI-13** / **TP-CLI-16** / **TP-CLI-18**.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **Sudoers family submenu** (copied from sibling grok-cli). The numbered start list is **backup**, **restore**, family **sudoers**, then **9. Exit**. Pick **3** / `sudoers` opens grant/draft setup: `generate-sudoer-request` (JSON grant), `submit-sudoer-request` (inbound queue), `print-sudoers` (sudoers text), `print-sudoers-install-script` (admin script), `remove-project-sudoers` (remove draft). **Back 8** / **Exit 9**. Each of those five remains a live CLI verb. `folder-backup sudoers` stays unknown. Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.5.0** · CLI-interface **1.8.0** · domain **1.6.3**. Suite **TP-CLI-13** · **TP-CLI-16** · **TP-CLI-18**.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **Numbered work list uses the default CLI main menu style.** On a real terminal the header is **folder-backup**(*live version*) (bold name, italic version). Each command description after the colon is italic and light gray. Scripts and pipes stay plain (no color codes). Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.4.0** · **requirement-shell-output-requirements** **1.1.0**. Suite **TP-CLI-18** (portable look family **TP-CLI-17**; this product already used 17 for the help heading split).

## [1.14.0] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- **Storage means cache folder and persistence.** Persistence is `${HOME}/.local/folder-backup/` (created; shown as **Persistence storage** / JSON `persistent_storage`). Cache family is unchanged (preferred `/dev/shm/cache/cache-folder-backup`). Persistence is **not** `${HOME}/.local/bin`. Sudoers drafts stay under `${HOME}/.config/folder-backup/` until a later dest re-home. Law: **requirement-shell-cli-storage** **1.2.0**. Suite **TP-CLI-06** · **TP-CLI-12**.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- **About names cache folders, not “storage effective.”** Human `about` prints **Cache folder (preferred)** `/dev/shm/cache/cache-folder-backup` and **Cache folder (fallback)** `${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/cache-folder-backup`. JSON adds `cache_preferred` / `cache_fallback` (live chosen root remains `effective_storage`). Preferred cache is no longer `/dev/shm/folder-backup-<user>` (that looks like a ram-drive project folder). Law: **requirement-shell-cli-storage** **1.1.0**. Suite **TP-CLI-06** · **TP-CLI-12**.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- **Bare `folder-backup` on a real terminal opens the numbered work list.** Off-TTY (scripts, pipes, CI) a bare run still prints help and does not install. Named `menu` / `main` still open the same list. Flags-only `--json` is JSON help (not the list). Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** **1.3.0** (case 2); CLI-interface **1.7.0**. **requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments** is **Withdrawn**. Suite **TP-CLI-07** (off-TTY help) · **TP-CLI-13** (TTY empty argv + `menu`) · **TP-CLI-15** (flags-only `--json`).

- **Sudoers `--json` twins are now MUST in law.** Text `print-sudoers` already emits `--json backup *` / `--json restore *`. Compact JSON emit is an honest **Gap** until `fb_sudoers_json_text` includes those `commands[]` objects (AC-26). Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-27** remains **todo**. Law: sudoer-json **1.4.0** · three-layer **1.12.0**.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **`menu` / `main` numbered work list.** On a real terminal, `folder-backup menu` (or `main`) prints four operational rows plus **9. Exit** (`backup` / `restore` / `remove-project-sudoers` / `submit-sudoer-request`). Labels are `verb: explain`. Off-TTY, `menu` is help (JSON help with `--json`); `--quiet` does not swallow that help. Empty argv stays help. Self-managed, `version`/`about`, and test-purpose grant-emit verbs stay off the list. Law: **requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction** (Gap closed) · CLI-interface **1.6.0**. Suite **TP-CLI-13..16**.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- **Sudoers emit matches `backup <folder>`.** `print-sudoers` / JSON grant now use sudoers `*` (one extra operand): text `… folder-backup backup *` and `restore *` (plus `--json` argv lines); JSON `args: ["backup", "*"]` / `["restore", "*"]`. Verb-only exact-argv is withdrawn (INC-20260823-001). Law: three-layer **1.11.0** AC-25 · sudoer-json **1.3.0**. Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-26 / 26b**.
- Host fragment is still admin-installed. Type 0 does not write `/etc`. Deposit internals may still use `sudo -n mkdir`/`cp` when not already root.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Law **`requirement-operator-readable-error`**: blocking errors must be understandable (what happened / next step). Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-25 / 25b / 25c**. Portable: **`LM-OPERATOR-READABLE-ERROR`** · **`SK-OPERATOR-READABLE-ERROR`** · **`CL-OPERATOR-READABLE-ERROR`**.
- **`generate-sudoer-request [path]`** writes a local JSON sudoer file (compact; `backup` and `restore`) and verifies it. Default: `~/.config/folder-backup/sudoer-request-<user>.json`. Does not write `/etc` or inbound. When `sudoer-cli` is present, `json-to-sudoers` must still list both verbs. Next step is `submit-sudoer-request <path>`.
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-24 / 24b / 24c / 24d**. Law: three-layer **1.10.0** AC-23/24 · domain **1.6.1** · CLI **1.3.1** · sudoer-json **1.2.0**. Incident **INC-20260817-002**.

### Changed

- **`submit-sudoer-request` default handoff is compact JSON** (same grant as pretty `print-sudoers` dual) so sibling convert keeps both verbs. Inbound fail-closed copy names the missing grant, the request id, and `generate-sudoer-request`.
- **Independent generate (sacred):** any sudoer generate is a Type 0 subcommand that writes a dest tests and review can read without sudo. Submit temp / inbound / `/etc` are not that dest.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`submit-sudoer-request` defaults to `update`** when this user’s host fragment exists under `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>` (or legacy `folder-backup`). Otherwise **add**. `--update` / `--add` override. Other users’ fragments do not count. `about --json` reports `host_sudoers_present`.
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-23 / 23b** (`SUDOERS_D_DIR` isolate). Law: three-layer **1.8.0** AC-22.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Submit **inbound fidelity** (AC-9 / three-layer AC-21): when the queued request file is readable, `submit-sudoer-request` **fails closed** if sibling re-encode dropped `backup` or `restore`. Purpose text is not completeness.
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-22e / 22f**: pretty emit through real `sudoer-cli` keeps both verbs; stub inbound body is read (not only file count).
- Law: `requirement-sudoer-json-file` **1.1.0** · three-layer **1.7.0**. Incident **INC-20260817-001**.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **Sudoers grant is the project command only.** `print-sudoers` / submit emit `${GLOBAL_BIN}/folder-backup backup` and `restore` (JSON dual written as `<draft>.json`). No `mkdir`/`cp`/`tar`/`rm`/`install`/`chmod` Cmnds — those extra tools increased complexity and weakened security.
- **Warning:** Runtime deposit/restore/retention still call `sudo -n mkdir`/`cp`/`tar`/`rm`. **Do not replace** a working OS-tool host fragment with this grant until `backup`/`restore` re-exec via the project command. Submit **refuses** leftover OS-tool files (AC-7).
- Law: `requirement-sudoer-json-file` **1.0.1** · three-layer **1.6.0** (JSON body deferred) · domain **1.4.1**
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-22 / 22b / 22c**; 01/01c/01d/02 assert the new grant shape.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **`submit-sudoer-request`** targets sudoer-cli’s **public inbound** `/var/sudoer-cli/sudoer-request` (mode 3773). Sibling CLI allocates the JSON request. This CLI does **not** write `/etc` and does **not** `mkdir` inbound.
- Detect order: `SUDOER_QUEUE_INBOUND` → `${SUDOER_PUBLIC_ROOT}/sudoer-request` → F4 `…/sudoer-request` → legacy `sudoer-approving` last.
- Help/about name the public inbound; `prompt_*` consume `TTY`; submit scratch uses `util_mktemp`.
- Law: three-layer **1.5.0** (AC-16–19) · domain **1.4.0** · CLI interface **1.1.0**
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-21 / 21b** (public preferred; env override wins; no Type 0 mkdir)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Detect sudoer-cli and sudoer-adm** on `about` (human + `--json`): path / absent / inbound writable.
- **`submit-sudoer-request`** (Type 0): queue this product's sudoers fragment into the inbound approval folder via sudoer-cli. Does **not** write `/etc`. Requires sudoer-cli + sudoer-adm + writable `sudoer-approving`. Flags: `--purpose`, `--update`, optional file operand, same `--allow-test-local` gate as `print-sudoers`.
- Law: `requirement-domain-folder-backup` 1.3.0 · `requirement-three-layer-privilege-model` 1.4.0 §2.3.3c
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-19 / 20** · help/about **TP-CLI-04 / 06** fields

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.7.0**
- `print-sudoers` fragment now starts with `# Purpose:` (shared helper for submit)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- **Bootstrap origin** is now sibling **cli-template** (Type 0 local-only template). Direction **A → B only**. `selfmanaged` is retired history, not a live hop.
- Ship unit Type 0 body rebuilt from `cli-template`, then domain (`fb_*`) re-extended. Online / Type O remain absent (already absent on A).
- Law: `requirement-bootstrap-chain` **2.0.0**; class / domain / shell notes retargeted.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Retention after successful backup** (per project basename under deposit):
  - **`MAX_DAILY_BACKUPS`** default **5** — prune oldest same-day `N` until ≤5
  - **`MAX_TOTAL_BACKUPS`** default **30** — prune oldest (day then `N`) until ≤30
  - Order: daily prune, then total prune
- **Sudoers** allowlisted `rm -f` of deposit `*.tar.gz` for root-owned prune
- Law: `requirement-folder-archive-backup-retention-daily` · `requirement-folder-archive-backup-retention-total` (molds LM-*-RETENTION-*)
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-17 / 17b / 18 / 18b**

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.6.0**
- Type 0 deposit when `BACKUP_ROOT` notation dir is user-writable (tests / custom roots)
- `about` / help report retention caps; backup JSON includes retention_* fields

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **Restore dest gate (INC-20260812-001)** — pure ban on all `/etc/*` blocked legitimate homes such as `/etc/sudo-adm`. Gate is now **whitelist-oriented**:
  - **W-ETC-USER:** allow `/etc/{{username}}` and children for the **invoking** user only
  - **Hard deny:** exact `/etc`, **`/etc/passwd`**, deposit tree, other FHS under-prefixes not on whitelist
  - **W-HOME:** invoking passwd home (and under) still allowed when not already covered

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.5.0**
- `requirement-folder-archive-backup` **1.2.0** §2.6b.2a (AC-15..18)
- Mold **`LM-FOLDER-ARCHIVE-BACKUP`** **1.2.0** §2.8b
- Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-16**

## [1.4.4] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **Multi-user project-sudoers-file overwrite** — draft and installed basenames now include the **user suffix** so admin install for user A does not overwrite user B:
  - Draft: `~/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment-<user>` (legacy `sudoers.fragment` still discoverable)
  - Host: `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup-<user>` (legacy `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup` still probed)
- **`remove-project-sudoers` multi-draft** — lists drafts under config and lets the user choose interactively; non-interactive requires an explicit path. Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-15b**.

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.4.4**; three-layer REQ **1.3.0** (AC-14/AC-15); term `project-sudoers-file` portable paths.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **Global/local install mode** — managed binary now uses absolute mode **`0755`**. Prior `chmod +x` after `mktemp` (`0600`) produced **`0711`** (`rwx--x--x`): shell ship unit was not readable by non-owners, so normal users could not run a root global install. Re-running `install` without `--force` also **heals** broken `0700`/`0711` modes. Suites **TP-LC-09**, **TP-LC-10**.

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.4.3**; `requirement-shell-local-self-management` **1.2.0** §2.3.1 multi-user mode law; project-folder install mode note.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **`remove-project-sudoers` honesty** — probe `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup` instead of hedging “if any”; when host elev is present, warn **STILL ACTIVE** and give admin leave-elev (`sudo rm` and/or install-script `uninstall`); when absent, say host fragment also absent. JSON includes `host_fragment_present`. Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-15**.

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.4.2**; three-layer REQ §2.3.3b / AC-13 probe wording.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **`remove-project-sudoers [path]`** — Type 0 removes the **project-sudoers-file** draft only (default `~/.config/folder-backup/sudoers.fragment`); confirm or `--force`; refuses `/etc`; warns installed host fragment is separate (admin script `uninstall`). Suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-15**.

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.4.1**; domain + three-layer REQs §2.3.3b; mold portable §2.3.3b.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **`print-sudoers-install-script [path]`** — Type 0 generates an admin shell script (prefer `/dev/shm/{{APP_NAME}}-<user>-sudoers-admin.sh`) with `install` / `uninstall` / `replace` / `status` so a sudo-capable account can install or remove the **project-sudoers-file** under `/etc/sudoers.d/` without the CLI writing `/etc`.
- Terminology **`project-sudoers-file`** (draft path + handoff); suite **TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-14**.
- Harness aligned from RAM genesis (S11–S12 elev tables + **S13** trust tier) then pushed portable deltas back to RAM/HD genesis.

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.4.0**; domain/three-layer REQs document admin-script workflow.
- Help/examples include install-script handoff for leaving test elevation (`uninstall`).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-09

### Security

- **Sudoers trust tiers:** global managed binary = production; local-only = **test mode only** (user can rewrite `~/.local/bin` and stage content).
- `print-sudoers` refuses non-production tier unless `--allow-test-local` or `ALLOW_TEST_LOCAL_SUDOERS=1`.
- Fragment headers and human output warn **TEST MODE ONLY / uninstall soon** for test_local.
- Stage allowlists tightened to **per-user** roots (`folder-backup-<user>/`), not broad `folder-backup-*`.
- Harness: `SK-CREATE-SUDOERS-FILE` v1.1, checklist **S11**, `LM-THREE-LAYER-PRIVILEGE-MODEL` v2.1, product three-layer requirement v1.2.
- Re-review: `reviews/reports/2026-08-09-sudoers-security-folder-backup.md` (Pass test only). WS record marked **test / to-uninstall**.

### Added

- `install --global` / `FORCE_GLOBAL=1` to target `/usr/local/bin` when writable.
- `about` reports `sudoers_trust_tier`.
- Uninstall warns that `/etc/sudoers.d/folder-backup` is not removed.
- Suite: TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-01b refuse without allow flag; 01c restore stage with allow flag.

### Changed

- Version SSOT **1.3.0** on ship unit.
- README / SECURITY.md document production vs test elevation paths.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Config repository identity: `REPO_USER=cloudgen`, `REPO_NAME=folder-backup` (project-repository alignment; `SCRIPT_URL` remains empty for local-only install).
- `about` / `--json about` report `repository` / `repo_user` / `repo_name` / `script_url`.
- Product README documents source repository and `REPO_*` env vars.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- `restore <archive|prefix> [dest]` with count verification after extract.
- Default restore destination host is **hard-disk** (`PROJECTS_ROOT/<project>`) — reverse of ram-drive-first; override with `--ram`, `--disk`, or an explicit path.
- Sudoers fragment lines for restore: allowlisted `cp` from deposit into per-user stage (Type 0 `tar -xzf` after).
- Domain surface and ops requirement coverage for restore; suite cases TP-FOLDER-BACKUP-11..13.
- Product harness skill `SK-FOLDER-ARCHIVE-BACKUP` and related sudoers create skill.

### Changed

- Backup flow reports source/archive file and member counts; deposit size verification.
- `print-sudoers` includes `tar -tzf` list allowlist and restore stage fetch.
- Version SSOT **1.2.0** on ship unit.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Post-deposit verification (stage counts + deposit size; optional elevated `tar -tzf` re-list).
- `print-sudoers` allowlist for deposit listing.

### Fixed

- Fail-closed deposit path retained when sudoers missing.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Initial specialized product **folder-backup**: local install/uninstall, backup with elevated deposit, print-sudoers, isolated test suite.
